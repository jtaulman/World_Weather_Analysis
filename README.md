## Outcome
Once the data was run for the current time of year with temperature restrictions of 75-90 degrees Ferenheit, a map appeared showing the best places to visit. That was majority of the Southern Hemishpere and countries around the equator because they are currently in their Summer season.

After seeing the map, one would be able to click on the different icons to see the exact hotel and location for each city. This project is very beneficial for people that want to travel but are unaware of where to visit. The program will give multiple locations that are new or were previously looked over when trying to find a vacation destination.
